## Description

Build-A-Career is a React.js web application with fully implemented Mongo.db back-end server. The user is presented with the ability to create a resume, cover letter, and linkedin template/pdfs. Once the user has completed either one of these documents they are then able to export the file as a pdf to their email or local computer. To further push the uses of the app, the user can create an account to revisit past documents for further editing, exportation, ect.
